## About the Project

The File Management System Frontend is a web application built with Vue.js and BootstrapVue that allows users to interact with a file management backend system. Users can upload, download, rename, and delete files, as well as create and navigate directories in a hierarchical structure.

This project was developed as part of an interview coding challenge to demonstrate proficiency in building a full-stack application with a RESTful API backend and a dynamic frontend.

## Features

•	File Management: Upload, List, download, update, and delete files.

•	Error Handling: Gracefully handles errors such as deleting non-existent files or directories that are not empty.

•	Database Storage: Metadata stored in a MySQL database.
